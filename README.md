# Interest Calculator Program

Project Summary: This project is to calculate interest accrual rate based on any amount initially deposited and for the desired number one years. This project will calculate calculate total balance at the end of every month as well as break down interest accrual by year.

What I did well: I got a functioning program that does everything that it is intended to do.

Where I can improve: I could potentially use Java in addition to C++ in order to provide secure code that's a little easier to read.

Challenges: My main challenge was getting the algorithm right for looping through the vector that held the interest data. This took a little bit of study and new undrestanding, but overall came out rather well.

Transferable skills: The use of vector and looping algorithm will be useful in many projects athroughout the software engineering world. Basic looping algorithms are vital for making efficient code.

Adaptability: This code is written in such a way that if the interest rate changes, only one variable needs updated. It is also written in such a way that it can be adapted to do other functions as well with minimal change to the existing code.
